This tool merges multiple Word (`.docx`) documents into one directly in your browser. The entire process is handled locally, so you can even disconnect from the Internet after the page loads and still finish the merge safely. When the merge is done you may also clear the file list.

## How to merge Word documents

1. **Batch upload files** – Click or drag files into the **“Upload Word files”** area. Multiple selection is supported and the number of selected files is shown below. Each file must be `.docx` and no larger than 50 MB.
2. **Adjust the merge order** – The merge follows the list (or card) from left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Drag a card or use the **Move Up / Move Down** buttons to reorder.
3. **Start merging** – When there are two or more valid files the **“Merge X documents”** button turns blue. Click to parse and merge. Once finished the merged file will download automatically.
4. **Preview or merge again** – After download you can drag more files in or delete old ones to merge again. Click **“Clear All”** to remove every file at once.
