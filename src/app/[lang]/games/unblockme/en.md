## Unblock Me Puzzle Overview

Unblock Me, also known as the classic Huarong Dao puzzle, asks you to slide wooden blocks inside a narrow board. **The goal is to guide the red block to the exit on the right edge** while keeping every other block within the board.

Core rules:

1. The red hero block is two cells wide and can only move horizontally;
2. Vertical blocks can only move up or down, horizontal blocks move sideways, and square blocks can move in both directions;
3. Blocks cannot overlap or leave the board, except when the red block slides out through the exit;
4. A level is cleared once the red block reaches the highlighted exit cell.

## Features On This Page

1. **A full level library:** 250 curated Unblock Me layouts ranging from beginner friendly to extremely challenging.
2. **Progress tracking:** best move count is remembered locally; you can always replay to improve your record.
3. **Undo and quick reset:** every move snapshot is stored so you can step back with one click or restart instantly.
4. **Mobile friendly:** drag blocks with touch gestures, with smooth snapping to the grid.

### Controls

- Drag any block with your mouse or finger; pieces slide only along their orientation (horizontal, vertical, or both for squares).
- The red hero block must reach the glowing exit stripe on the right edge to solve the level.
- Use the undo and restart buttons in the sidebar whenever you want to try a different idea.

## Strategy Tips

- Try to keep the central lane clear for the red block; plan several moves ahead instead of reacting to a single obstacle.
- Look for repeating patterns: many puzzles revolve around temporarily moving a long block to free a bottleneck.
- Avoid shuffling pieces without purpose. Count how many moves it takes for the red block to advance and focus on reducing that number.
- When you feel stuck, undo a few moves and explore a different idea rather than forcing the same pattern.
