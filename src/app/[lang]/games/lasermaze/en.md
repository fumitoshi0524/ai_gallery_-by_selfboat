## Goal

Guide the 45-degree laser so that it bounces off the movable mirror blocks and passes through every green target ring.

## How to Play

1. Drag a white mirror block to a new grid cell and release the mouse to drop it in place.
2. Mirrors always sit in the middle of a square. The laser only reflects when it hits the midpoint of one of the mirror’s edges.
3. Plan the bounce path so the laser reaches every target before it exits the board.
4. Use the level selector or the procedural difficulty buttons to try new layouts.

## Tips

- Keep mirrors away from the borders so the laser has room to reflect back across the board.
- Rotating the layout of just one mirror can dramatically change the path—experiment freely.
- Start by aiming for the hardest-to-reach target and work backwards to position the mirrors.
