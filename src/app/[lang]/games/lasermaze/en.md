title: Laser Maze Guide
---

Laser Maze is a reflective puzzle where every move reshapes the path of light. You control a set of movable mirror blocks on a square grid, and a laser enters the board from one side at a 45° angle. The goal is charmingly simple: steer the beam so it passes through each green target ring before it leaves the board. The challenge comes from planning the exact sequence of reflections needed to make that happen.

## Core Rules

**Mirrors sit in the middle of a tile and reflect light only when the laser hits the midpoint of one of their edges.** If the beam touches anywhere else, it continues straight until it meets a mirror or exits the board. You succeed when every target ring has been lit at least once during the beam's journey.

The game offers two kinds of layouts:

- **Preset levels** are hand-picked puzzles that increase in complexity. Each one is numbered in the selector and a checkmark will appear once you clear it.
- **Procedural levels** are generated on demand. Choose a difficulty tier to control the number of mirrors and targets, then click the generate button for a fresh challenge every time.

## Controls & Interface

- Drag a white mirror block to a new grid cell and release to confirm the move.
- Blocks snap to whole-tile coordinates; adjusting them by even a single square can completely change the resulting path.
- Use the selector on the right panel to switch between preset levels, or pick a procedural difficulty (1–3) and press **Generate Level** to create a new random puzzle.
- Click **Reset Level** if you want to undo all moves and restart the current layout.
- When a solution is available, the **Show / Hide Solution** button reveals blue dashed outlines that mark where the winning mirrors should sit.

A celebratory modal appears once you light up every target, and your progress for preset stages is saved locally so you can resume later.

## Strategy Tips

- Start by identifying the hardest target to reach and plan reflections backward from there.
- Avoid parking mirrors right against the outer border; leaving space often creates the extra reflection you need.
- Small adjustments matter. Try nudging a mirror by one tile in multiple directions to see how the beam reacts.
- If a procedural puzzle feels overwhelming, lower the difficulty, study how a simpler layout behaves, then ramp back up.
- Use the solution overlay judiciously—glance at it for inspiration, then hide it again and attempt to reproduce the path on your own.
